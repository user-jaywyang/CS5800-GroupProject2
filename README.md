Problem 1: House Robber
Files: house_robber.py and house_robber_input.json

Description: Run house_robber.py in your prefered IDE or terminal. Then import house_robber_input.json to run the selected algorithm. The Terminal commands can be ran by entering "python house_robber.py house_robber_input.json" in the Command line. 

Problem 2: Longest Common Subsequence
Files: LCS.hpp and LCS.cpp

Description: Both LCS.hpp and LCS.cpp should be in the same directory in an IDE, if that is not an option, you'll need to update the import for LCS.cpp to match your preferred directory. Once complete, you can import LCS.hpp into your main.cpp and use the method longestCommonSubsequence() with your preferred strings.
